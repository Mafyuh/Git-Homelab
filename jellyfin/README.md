# Homelab Physical Machine
Bought an old Dell Optiplex 3050 as it supports NVMe storage, DDR4 RAM, Disk reader slot which I exchanged for a LibreDrive compatible drive, and has an extra PCIe slot with just enough room for a low profile GPU.

## Specs
- Intel i5-6500 (4 core)
- 16GB DDR4 RAM
- Intel Arc A310 GPU (transcoding)
- 500GB NVMe SSD
- LG BU40N UHD Bluray drive

## OS
